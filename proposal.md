# GitHub Repository Tree Viewer – Project Proposal

## 1. Overview
The **GitHub Repository Tree Viewer** is a tool that allows developers to visualize any GitHub repository’s file structure in a clean, ASCII tree format. By automating the process of fetching, parsing, and rendering repository contents, this project provides an intuitive way to quickly understand code organization—particularly useful for large repositories or when onboarding to a new project.

## 2. Key Components

### Go Backend Server
- **Fetch & Parse:** Interacts with the GitHub API to retrieve repository contents and metadata.  
- **Tree Generation:** Converts file and directory data into a formatted ASCII tree output.  
- **Auth & Rate Limits:** Supports GitHub token-based authentication and handles API rate limiting.

### Web Client
- **Single-Page Application:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for responsiveness and ease of use.  
- **Dark/Light Modes:** Allows users to toggle between themes.  
- **Live Updates:** Streams the ASCII tree as it is generated by the backend.  
- **Copy-to-Clipboard:** One-click copying of the tree view for quick sharing.

### Browser Extension
- **GitHub Integration:** Injects a “Tree View” button directly on GitHub repository pages.  
- **Seamless Experience:** Minimizes context-switching for developers who prefer working within GitHub’s interface.

### Docker Deployment
- **Containerization:** Utilizes Docker to package backend and frontend for a consistent deployment process.  
- **Orchestration:** Employs Docker Compose for running multiple services (backend, frontend, etc.) together.

## 3. Why This Project?
- **Developer Productivity:** Quickly assess or share a project’s structure without cloning locally.  
- **Code Reviews:** Speeds up navigations during pull requests or code reviews.  
- **Onboarding:** Offers newcomers an immediate overview of a repository’s organization.

## 4. Weekly Schedule

**Week 1:**  
- Finalize project scope and architecture.  
- Set up the Go backend skeleton and connect to the GitHub REST API.  
- Review GitHub API documentation and plan error-handling, rate limit strategies.

**Week 2:**  
- Implement the repository file-structure fetching logic.  
- Develop the initial ASCII tree generator in Go.  
- Write basic tests for API interactions and tree-formatting functions.

**Week 3:**  
- Create the basic web client (HTML/CSS/JS) and integrate it with the Go backend.  
- Implement the real-time streaming of ASCII tree results.  
- Add copy-to-clipboard functionality.

**Week 4:**  
- Enhance the frontend with dark/light mode toggles and responsive design.  
- Begin work on the browser extension: inject a “Tree View” button on GitHub pages.  
- Conduct cross-browser testing (Chrome/Firefox).

**Week 5:**  
- Finish browser extension features and polish UI.  
- Set up Docker containers for backend and frontend, plus Docker Compose.  
- Start integration testing and refine documentation.

**Week 6:**  
- Conduct final QA tests for all components (backend, web client, and extension).  
- Prepare project demonstration materials and user guide.  
- Submit final version and deployment instructions.

## 5. Potential Future Enhancements
- **Support for Other Platforms:** Extend API integrations to GitLab and Bitbucket.  
- **Advanced Filters & Large Repos:** Implement partial loading and filtering for massive repositories.  
- **Comparison Views:** Compare file structures across different branches or repositories.  
- **Size Visualization:** Show approximate file sizes alongside the ASCII tree.
