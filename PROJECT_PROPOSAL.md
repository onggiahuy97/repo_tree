# GitHub Repository Tree Viewer - Project Proposal

## Project Overview
The GitHub Repository Tree Viewer is a tool that allows developers to visualize repository file structures in a clean, ASCII tree format. This project aims to provide an intuitive way to understand repository organization without needing to navigate through multiple folders on GitHub.

## Key Components

### 1. Go Backend Server
- Interfaces with GitHub API to fetch repository file structures
- Converts repository data into formatted ASCII tree output
- Supports authentication via GitHub tokens for API access
- Handles API rate limiting and error cases

### 2. Web Client
- Responsive single-page application
- Dark/light mode toggle for user preference
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Live streaming of tree generation results
- Mobile-friendly design

### 3. Browser Extension
- Adds "ðŸŒ² Tree View" button to GitHub repository pages
- Seamlessly integrates with the GitHub UI
- Provides quick access to tree visualization of current repository

### 4. Docker Deployment
- Containerized setup for easy deployment
- Separate containers for backend and frontend
- Docker Compose configuration for orchestration

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Go
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Extension**: JavaScript (Browser Extension API)
- **Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose

## Value Proposition
- **For Developers**: Quickly understand repository structure without downloading or cloning
- **For Code Reviewers**: Easily assess code organization during pull request reviews
- **For New Contributors**: Get a high-level overview of project organization

## Implementation Timeline
1. **Phase 1**: Core backend functionality with GitHub API integration
2. **Phase 2**: Web client implementation with basic UI
3. **Phase 3**: Enhanced features (copy, dark mode, responsive design)
4. **Phase 4**: Browser extension development
5. **Phase 5**: Containerization and deployment configuration

## Future Enhancements
- Support for other Git platforms (GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Advanced filtering options for large repositories
- Repository comparison views
- Directory size visualization
- Integration with GitHub authentication for private repositories

## Conclusion
The GitHub Repository Tree Viewer addresses a common need for developers to quickly understand repository structure. By combining a powerful backend with an intuitive frontend and browser extension, this tool streamlines the repository exploration experience.
